# App Catalogue

This repository is the catalogue for BIBBOX Apps.

## Register an App
For the registration of an app two configuration files have to be extended:

- `applications.json` maps a Github repository to a human readable name of the App

- `bibbox.json` puts the App into a specific kit. A kit defines ta group of Apps together with metadata, which are then displayed in the App store and can be installed in a BIBBOX instance.
