# App Catalogue

This repository is the catalogue for BIBBOX Apps.

## Register an App
For the registration of an app two configuration files have to be extended:

- The file `applications.json` maps a Github repository to a human-readable name of the App.

- The file `bibbox.json` groups the Apps into specific categories, according to their functionality.


Once the App is published it becomes available for installation at the App Store of the BIBBOX Portal. Once a user installs an App, its installation will appear on "App Instances". Users can browse all the Apps available in the "App Store" and install them. In the "App Instances", users can access all the current installation instances of the Apps.
